# 2D-HP_Protein_Folding
Simulated folding of proteins in the 2D-HP model using genetic algorithms

## Installation

Compile the program using any C++ compiler. Generating images requires you to add the [C++ Bitmap Library](https://github.com/ArashPartow/bitmap) to the project root.

## Usage

You can define a bitstring for processing and adjust the parameters for the genetic algorithm in *main.cpp*.

A CSV file containing an overview of each generation's performance as well as a rendered image of each generation's best candidate will be saved in the working directory.
